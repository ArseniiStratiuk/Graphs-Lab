# Lab 2: Graphs and Algorithms

This repository contains solutions for **Lab 2** on graph representations, traversal algorithms, and analysis.

## Tasks

1. **Graph Representation (1 point)**
   Read a graph from a `.dot` file into:
   - Incidence matrix
   - Adjacency matrix
   - Adjacency dictionary

2. **Recursive Search (1 point)**
   Implement BFS and DFS using recursion for:
   - Adjacency matrix
   - Adjacency dictionary

3. **Iterative Search (1 point)**
   Implement BFS and DFS using iteration for one graph type.

5. **Radius Calculation (Bonus, 0.5 points)**  
   Calculate the graph radius for all graph types.  

6. **Performance Analysis (Bonus, 0.5 points)**
   Compare the performance of the algorithms with different graph sizes. Include graphs of results.
